## FAQ

*What is 'MERN'?*
- An fullstack application that utilises a tech stack of (M) Mongo-DB, (E) Express, (R) React and (N) NodeJS

## Bugs & Fixes/Updates

### Updates

### Bugs

- Notes Page: The webpage goes blank/crashes if a user deletes completely clears all notes
- Navigation/URL: When users enter the URL from an endpoint other than the root, the app returns

2. Clone this repository onto your local system
    - open your terminal (Git Bash or Linux)
    - create a directory to host the project and enter it 
    `mkdir <dirname> && cd $_`
    - clone the repository into the current directory and open in vscode
    `git clone https://github.com/Cams-Plan/LAP3-study-buddy-app.git . && code .`
3. Users will not be able to make any changes to the main branch of this repo, so any changes must be done on your own fork.

## Run This App Locally on Your System

### Pre-requisites:
- VS Code
- Node 18 (and up)
- Docker Desktop
- Docker Extension
### Install Packages
- **Server**
    - enter the server directory
    `cd server` (if in root of the project)
    - install the packages
    `npm i` OR `npm i && npm i -D`
    *if successful there will be a package-lock.json in the root of the server directory*
    [Setup the Server](#setup-the-server)

- **Client**
    - enter the client directory
        - `cd server` (if in root of the project)
    - install the packages
        - `npm i` OR `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
    - *if successful there will be a package-lock.json in the root of the server directory*
    [Setup the client](#setup-the-client)

### Setup
when setting up the client or server, your pwd must be the directory you are targeting, don't forget. check your path or use `pwd` to double check as you go
#### Setup The Server

##### If using .env
- create a *.env* file within the root of the server directory
- enter the values for all capitalised variables
(DB_CONNECTION (database URI), PORT (localhost port))
###### Run the Docker container
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Run the docker container for the database. This can be done two ways:

    matching the entry point to mongodb
    - `docker run --rm -d -p 27017:27017 --name studyApp-db mongo`

    using a custom port as an entry point
    - `docker run --rm -d -p <custom_port>:27017 --name studyApp-db mongo`

    *__Note: If you're using an entry point other than 27017__, you __must__ have a DB_CONNECTION variable with the non-default port. e.g. mongodb://localhost:9000/studyApp-db*
3. Access the database
    - `docker exec -it <db_container_name> mongosh`
4. Enter the studyApp-db database to access the data collections
    - `use studyApp-db`
- *Should be empty since the server hasn't been started up at any point ( enter the command `show collecitons` to check)*
###### Start the Server
1. open a new terminal to run the server
2. check your environment variables are correct in your .env file
3. run the command to start the server
    - `npm run dev`
- *If successful all expected logs for the server initialisation and database connection should be in the console*
4. Switch over to the mongodb terminal. If you run the command `show collections`, there should be collections for every database schema model.

**The Server is now ready! üòÅüíª‚úî**
    
##### If NOT using .env
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Run the docker container for the database
    - `docker run --rm -d -p 27017:27017 --name studyApp-db mongo`
3. Access the database
    - `docker exec -it <db_container_name> mongosh`
4. Enter the studyApp-db database to access the data collections
    - `use studyApp-db`
    - *Should be empty since the server hasn't been started up at any point (`show collecitons` to check)*
###### Start the Server
1. open a new terminal to run the server
2. check your environment variables are correct in your .env file
3. run the command to start the server
    - `npm run dev`
- *If successful all expected logs for the server initialisation and database connection should be in the console*
4. Switch over to the mongodb terminal. If you run the command `show collections`, there should be collections for every database schema model.

**The Server is now ready! üòÅüíª‚úî**

#### Setup The Client

*if packages have not been installed please navigate up to [Install Packages](#install-packages)*

1. Open a new terminal for the vite server
2. Ensure you're in the ./client directory of the project in your terminal.
3. **If you used a .env file with a PORT variable for your server port**, ensure all axios "localhost:<port_number>/" (defaulted to 5000 for this project) matches the port for your server.
- *To do this, navigate to [files with axios requests](#files-with-axios-requests-to-server) to save you time looking through every file in ./src*
4. run the command to start the react app
    - `npm run dev`
    - it should return a localhost to open the react app in-browser
